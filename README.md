Directional WiFi Tool mainly to be used with Yaggi antennas.

Currently this python script only works on Mac's. Eventually it will be ported to Linux and will more than likely work better.

Ultimately this script will allow directional antenna owners to automatically pin point access points based on signal strength. Which will allow people to locate them.

I am currently building a motorised based for my antenna mounted on a tripod which will turn towards the AP of your choice based on it's strength.

As you get closer, the antenna will turn and point in the direction of the AP.

Also, I'd like to add more helpful actions within the script for mac users.
